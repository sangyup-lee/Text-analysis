The entire movie was only tons and tons of filler with nothing interesting except for the three fight scenes, which were all ridiculous. Wonder Woman is to me just a ripoff of Captain America. The whole world war setting, the shield which can deflect bullets and mortar rounds, and how she can just dodge and see bullets coming, was pulled straight from Captain America. As a woman, i am an active feminist and i was glad they finally made a movie where women star in acting and directing roles. However, to me this movie falls just ahead of Catwoman in ratings. Don't waste your time and money with this movie.\"\n",

There's a lot to love about Spiderman Homecoming, from Tom Holland's take on a teenage Peter Parker (although the tone of his voice grated from time to time) to a solid villain in Vulture, played to perfection by Michael Keaton. There were also some awesome action sequences, my favs being the ferry and the final battle against The Vulture. Sadly, the emotional connection I needed, to make this a truly awesome version of Spidey never came (for me) Raimi's Spiderman 2 hit every note perfectly, and is still in my humble opinion the best Spidey movie out there. While this one looks good, the depth is sorely lacking and with the way Wonder Woman left me feeling so fresh in my head, it was just more obvious to me, that they played it safe and pandered to the easiest base to appease, the Spidey fans, with this one. \"\n",

We ALL know Peter gets bit by a radioactive spider which gives him his powers. DONE! Point scored to fans! Let's move on. Second, Spider-Man Homecoming is still a Sony film but Marvel Studios has MUCH of the creative control when they struck a deal. What this means for fans is, we finally get to see a Spider-Man that we want! ... All in All, this film hits a freaking home run! It's funny, action packed, great writing, true to the character/source material, and leads into some serious Avenger easter eggs! I LOVED THIS version of Spider- Man!! I still love 2002's Spider-Man, but this is leading right into the future of the MCU. EXCELSIOR !!!!! \"\n",
